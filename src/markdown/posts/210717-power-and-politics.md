title: "Power, Politics, Capitalism, and Political Persuasion"

I spend a lot of time thinking about politics from a holistic perspective,
trying to understand the nature of political systems and progress and
persuasion. For instance, [I've recently been experimenting with writing some
code to simulate government structures and how they warp the political
persuasion of the populace into a more liberal or conservative country than
their people are by nature][0]. It doesn't work yet. It basically says the USA
is 100% liberal because it passes every proposed law. Obviously I have a bug.
But it's fun, and interesting.

Recently I've been finding myself in some conversations with a few friends, one
French, another American, and I end up talking about the nature of power,
political persuasion, race, and progress in a much more fundamental way. I
figure it's time to start formalizing these thoughts into something like a
system.

I am not a researcher, just a reader and thinker. So a ton of my ideas are
gleaned from reading things, incorporating the ideas, and then forgetting the
origin. A lot of these ideas are not original, and I wish I could easily link to
the places where I first heard them. Please don't think I'm taking credit for
ideas that have origins elsewhere. I just believe them, and want to write them
down.

# Openness and Closedness are the Fundamental Political Axis

I recently wrote [5000 words on the Negroni, Comfort Cocktails, and Political
Persuasion][1] that are probably far too discursive for their own good. But one
thing I repeatedly hammer on in that essay is the nature of openness and it's
relation to liberalness and conservativeness.

There's been a lot of hay made by the Economist set lately about the
[open-closed political spectrum][2]. The idea, recently, has been that this is
the new political dynamic. I find this really intriguing. Not the concept of
open-closed, but the idea that this is _new_. I think the reality is that
politics have _always_ been about open-closed. It's just that our politics have
rarely been so starkly about conservative-liberal differences. Because our
political parties are not _instinctually_ political like we are.

Breaking down political persuasion can be complex. We have the traditional
left-right division, the two dimensional political compass (where the vertical
axis is social and the horizontal axis is fiscal), and now a plethora of axes
systems. I love taking them, and usually bookmark my results. Some sites I've
saved the results from have since gone dark, but here are some of my results
from different tests:

- [8values][3]
- [9axes][4]
- [The Take Machine][5]
- [Political Compass][6]

Political persuasion is a mess of interests, identity, and social connections.
The political institutions in your country can also seriously influence the way
citizens recognize their political identity. In multi party systems people often
gravitate into smaller camps (environmentalists, labor, commerce, etc) whereas
in big tent party countries like the United States and the UK political
persuasion is typically more holistic. The way you end up building your
positions can follow a simple route: you're concerned with an issue that one
party agrees with, you follow that party, you therefore adopt their other
positions with which you are less concerned.

But this is too nitty gritty. A detailed analysis of political persuasion,
evolution, and identity on an individual level would find some really
interesting psychological dynamics involving group identity, personal interests,
knee jerk responses, and people with vaguely or ill-defined political attitudes
that become starkly polarized under different circumstances.

Conservatism and Liberalism have pretty obvious roots: to conserve something is
to keep it the same, prevent it from running out, to be more reserved.
Liberalism is to change things, accept new ways of doing things, and be more
open. These aren't controversial definitions. Edmund Burke laid out Conservatism
during the French Revolution pretty clearly: it's an instinct that tradition and
historical institutions are meaningful and worth keeping. And John Stuart Mill
laid out Liberalism pretty clearly in On Liberty: it's to be accepting of
virtually anything that doesn't hurt anyone else.

We can sit here and talk about how the modern Republican party is the
blow-it-all-up party and the modern liberal party is the party of big government
and regulation (not "Libertarianism" or "Classical Liberalism" as JS Mill
defined) but this is to really miss the point. Edmund Burke saw Conservatism as
not so much an ideology but an instinct. Because it is! It's not an ideology,
and it's not a system of philosophy with rigorous principes. And, in my
estimation, neither the hell is Liberalism, no matter what the Wikipedia wants
to say.

Adam Gopnik, my favorite essayist, recently wrote a book, titled [A Thousand
Small Sanities][7], about the concept of liberalism and how it just comes down
to a mentality of experimentation and progress. Learning through practice. And
this is the reason Liberalism tends toward big government economic solutions in
the 20th and 21st century and in no way resembles Classical Liberalism: Liberals
saw what unchecked capitalism can do. They saw the sweat shops and child labor
and [Triangle Shirtwaist Factory][19] and _learned from it_. But that's what
Liberalism is about, openness to experience _and learning from it_, not abstract
concepts of "liberty" and "rule of law." These concepts _are_ liberal, but they
are not _Liberalism_. They are ideas spawned _from_ the liberal instinct.

Contrariwise, Conservatism is the instinct to fear change. It is to recognize
that systems are fragile, that people are dangerous, and that society can, and
_has_ collapsed. As an instinct, Conservatism believes the people of the present
are _not_ free, but are duty-bound to shepherd the treasures bestowed upon us by
the past to the future.

So in the end, I cannot see Open-Closed as anything _other_ than
Liberal-Conservative, and I don't see how anyone can say otherwise. They are
inextricably, and biconditionally, the same dynamic.

And these two instincts are _fundamental_. Because politics is, and can _only_
be about, change.

# Conservatism and Original Sin

> You could not step twice into the same river.
>
> - Heraclitus

I often coin pithy statements that conceptualize my thinking. Liberals learn
from their mistakes, conservatives double down on them. I usually say this in
the heat of discussion about how I can't stand Trumplicans. It's unfair, but
accurate, to the politics of today. But it really does a disservice to
Conservatism.

Politics is the power structure that controls a society's legitimate means of
force. It is no more, and no less, than that. Howsoever the means of force
within that society are controlled, directed, and deployed is what we would call
a government. This can be concentrated into one decision maker (a King, or, as
we would call them now, a Dictator), or spread out, as in the case of Athenian
Democracy. It can be strong, as in the case of the United States where it is
impossible to defy, or it can be weak, as in the case of Somalia where there are
multiple competing factions and the government is incapable of maintaining
control as the sole source of legitimate force. The book The Narrow Corridor and
its "Shackled Leviathan" is a really enlightening window into this concept.

But there is one, and only one, truth about reality which politics has to
contend with: Change.

I feel like there's no reason to argue this, that there's no one that disagrees,
but it would behoove me to at least provide a little evidence for this.

You grow old. New people are born. They will say new words, come up with new
concepts, dress differently, live differently, and invent new things. They will
try new things. Some of these things will be good, and other people will take
them up. They will start new traditions, listen to new kinds of music, and eat
different kinds of food. You grew up one way, and that way will no longer exist,
even while you are still alive. You will have to deal with this. How you deal
with this, how you react to this, _is your politics_.

I rag on conservatives because I'm an instinctual liberal. But I'm an
intellectual conservative, so I want to give them their due. Plus, I don't think
any serious thinker about politics ever wants to try to define their terms and
analysis such that they write off an entire half of the political spectrum as
just bad and wrong. Systems of philosophy should incorporate and understand the
purpose of the structures of their subject without prejudice. I have prejudice,
against Conservatism, but I have to admit its correctness, in a lot of ways. And
the reason for this is simple:

_**You can go too fast.**_

There's this [famous fact about collisions and billiards balls][9] that after
the sixth collision of a ball, in order to calculate the trajectory and speed,
you would have to take into account the gravitational pull of all the
individuals in the room, and that after the 56th, you'd have to take into
account every molecule in the known universe. It's often mentioned when talking
about how hard it is to make predictions, even in deterministic, simple systems.

This is true in nearly every domain. For instance, we talk about how you can
kill one species and the result is a cascading domino effect of other species
dying out. Well, society is a very, _very_ nondeterministic and complex system.
Complex systems have interactions that are literally impossible to tease out.
Making a change to society, no matter how well-intentioned, can easily have
unintended consequences. Can easily have _bad_ consequences. Societally
destructive consequences.

One easily observable example is the emergence of reaction. I'll get to reaction
a little later, but consider the conservative who feels completely disconnected
from his society. It is a not-uncommon phenomenon that right wing violence
increases in times of extreme change. When people feel their way of life is
threatened, they tend to get angry, and violent.

There are certain deep, sublime, and terrifying truths about the human race. One
is that we are all capable of evil. Another is that we are all just talking
apes. We evolved, and are genetically destined, to have certain instincts and
behaviors that we are incapable of controlling. There are a lot of ways to
interpret the concepts of The Fall and Original Sin, but one very useful
interpretation is this: We are all sinners. We are all capable of evil. We
cannot avoid perpetrating that evil until we understand, recognize, and accept
that we are. And part of that is understanding, recognizing, and accepting that
those around us are _also_ capable of that same evil.

This is the conservative fear. We can move too fast, break something we don't
understand, and the result is [a][10] [mass][11] [outbreak][12] [of][13]
[death][14] [and][15] [violence][16]. You think you'd never do that? You think
your society is stronger than that?

**_[You're wrong.][17]_**

There's something more to be said about the conservative instinct as a balance
to the liberal instinct.

You cannot have a biological system without some mechanism for passing on
information. We call this DNA. We literally begin talking about biological
systems by starting with the evolution of information systems for reproduction.
DNA actually _had to evolve itself_ so there are earlier systems for passing on
information, but it is the fundamental construct of any biological system: an
information system.

_BUT_, you likewise cannot have advanced organisms and their evolution without
mutation. For every generation there are numerous mutations that occur. Some of
these are beneficial. They are reproduced and become a part of the main trunk of
genetic code for that species.

There are an insane amount of other features of evolution, including genetic
drift, functional equivalence, and spandrels, but at its most basic form, any
evolving, biological system has some means of passing on information, and some
means of introducing change.

This ability to evolve is not actually about progress. It's about dealing with,
and adapting to, changes in the environment. It changes, all the time. Climates
change, geography changes, the species around you change. If a species is not
adapting to a new environment, _constantly_, it will be out-competed,
out-reproduced, and it will die.

Well, as should be pretty obvious, a society is a massive organism.

Conservatives preserve the societal adaptations of the past while liberals
produce the changes for continuous adaptation. Naturally, these forces are
opposed, but symbiotic. Without Conservatism, without the preservation of the
past, there can be no evolution, no progress. Likewise, without Liberalism,
without mutation, there can be no evolution, no progress. Only a static, dying,
decadent society.

# Extremes and Neurosis

I like this evolutionary metaphor for political persuasion. I like it a lot.
They don't call it the Body Politic for nothing. One thing worth considering is
disease. When either of these forces becomes too strong. Namely, autoimmune
disorders and cancer.

I love to draw a spectrum like this:

```
<----Radicalism--------Liberalism--------Conservatism-------Reaction---->
```

The point on which my theory gets shakiest is here. On the extremes. Sometimes I
think Radicals are fundamentally different from Reactionaries, sometimes I think
the Horseshoe Theory is fundamentally right. Honestly, I think it is right.

You can get so liberal that you don't learn from experience and try new things
to advance but actively seek some ideal future that you have in your head. We
can call this radicalism.

You can also get so conservative that you don't remember the past and think it
was better than the present and want to go back to it. We call this Reaction.

The term radical is thrown around as not having a political position but it
really does. [Wikipedia][18]:

> The word radical derives from the Latin radix ("root") and Late Latin
> rādīcālis ("of or pertaining to the root, radical"). Historically, political
> use of the term referred exclusively to a form of progressive electoral
> reformism, known as Radicalism, that had developed in Europe during the 18th
> and 19th centuries. However, the denotation has changed since its 18th century
> coinage to comprehend the entire political spectrum, though retaining the
> connotation of "change at the root".

"But Michael, you said a word is only what it means to the people who use it!"
Shut the fuck up, most people use the word "Conservative" to mean Republican and
"Liberal" to mean Democrat and they have no idea what they are talking about. A
lot of words only mean what people use them to mean (e.g., decimate, literally,
silly), but these words have real meanings that continue in serious places but
of which the larger populace is ignorant. That doesn't mean the word doesn't
mean what academics think it means.

Regardless, just as mutation can result in cancer, and the protective instincts
of the immune system can start attacking itself, liberals can degrade a society
by _moving too fast_ and conservatives can degrade it by _rejecting all
progress_.

That is to say, a "conservative" is okay with progress, just as long as it's
slow, doesn't destroy the society, and is rooted in the past: Burke saw the
American Revolution as justified by basing its plaints in the Americans' Rights
as Englishmen, and the French Revolution as entirely _wrong_ because it based
its plaints on idealized Platonic rights invented by the mind. Whether you agree
with him or not, he's representative of a conservative system of belief. Our
Declaration of Independence is as much Burkean as it is Lockean, even if that
seems anachronistic:

> Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be
> changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath
> shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable,
> than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.
> But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same
> Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their
> right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new
> Guards for their future security.

# Political and Financial Power and the Sine Wave of Power

Okay, now that we've established how I see political persuasion, change, and
evolution in the body politic, I'd like to get into how I see the larger
evolution of politics and society.

I am an amateur philosopher. I studied it in school, so I know a lot of names,
and a lot of summaries of philosophers, but I'm not exactly "well-read" in a lot
of the philosophers that have influenced me. You might call me a poser, I say
I'm just really good at extrapolating full systems of philosophy from synopses
of theory.

There's an interesting dispute in social philosophy: what is the root struggle?
What is the root motivation of all human interaction? There's a lot of names
that don't directly argue with each other but that propose different
motivations. Freud believed sex was the basis. Marx believed capital (money).
Foucault, power. I'm inclined to believe them all, because they're all just
about survival. With sex, you reproduce and survive. With money, you have power.
And with power, you can ensure your survival.

I started writing this essay today because of a conversation with my friend
Alex, a frenchman involved in the wine trade and living in Chile. We were
talking about China and how it's not likely to grow as fast in the future
because it's an autocratic nation.

It's become a bit of a refrain that the West used to believe that with economic
freedom political freedom would follow and that the West was wrong, and China is
the proof. The refrain is correct: political power is the ultimate power, in
that it has the power to end financial power. Whenever any political power is
too concentrated, it will be abused, and usually to negative economic effect.
Because people with power will abuse it. Power corrupts, absolute power corrupts
absolutely. These are all goddamn clichés, but they're clichés for a reason.

Whenever any group of people has advantage over another group of people,
whenever they have _power_ over that other group of people, they will use that
power to their own advantage. This is the reason democracies often become
colonialist empires (see, for example, the United States and Athens). People
outside of that democracy have no political power within that country, and so
they are easily subjugated by that power. I'm on pretty shaky ground here,
[because I'm directly contradicting the theory that democracies don't go to war
with each other][10]. I think, though, the reason for that is largely economic:
democracies are almost always free market nations, and why go to war when you
can make money?

Countries like China, where power is absolutely concentrated in a nondemocratic
oligarchy (no matter how large it is, concentration is relative; I don't care
that the National People's Congress has nearly 3000 members, the country has 1.3
_billion_ damn people; futhermore, that Congress is not as "free" to vote it's
conscience as the legislatures of the West) can have economic prosperity in the
short term (which is, _necessarily_, a function of economic freedom), but can
never escape the runway of its own potential corruption.

If you doubt the necessity of economic freedom for a nation's prosperity you can
stop reading now. There exists no controlled economy in history of the world
which has ever prospered in the long term (i.e., on the order of even a hundred
years).

_On the other hand_ we can see a plethora of examples where too weak a
governmental institution results in poverty. The United States from 1880-1940 is
a great example of this: poverty was rampant, inequality was extreme, and abject
misery was the law of the land during a period of extreme economic freedom.

We can also see interesting examples of hypercapitalism where foreign
corporations take advantage of weak local governments to turn a profit. The
Bolivian Water Crisis is a fantastic example of this.

There is something fascinatingly perverse about financial power. It is utterly
intractable, mechanistic, unable to _think_ beyond the simple concept of profit.
The mechanism is obvious: if a company does _think_ beyond profit, another
company will beat it. It's nearly evolutionary. Financial power has no
conscience, no long term vision, no sense of selfhood. It is ineluctable.

And because it is entirely evolutionary and not at all dependent upon choices of
the people, it requires a check: the conscience of politics.

There are two powers in any country: financial and political. A society can only
truly be free when they keep each other in check.

We can actually try analyzing further than I ever have: the financial power of a
society is almost alimentary. It exists to feed consumption. It is the Social
Id. The political power, on the other hand, is the Social Ego. The one,
Dionysian, the other, Apollonian. Too free a market, addiction. Too restricted a
market, neurosis.
