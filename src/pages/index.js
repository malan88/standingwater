          Palmettos and slash pine, Muscadine running wild and ibises probing
          the damp ground after a thunderstorm. Standing water and mosquitos
          have been a part of this landscape for hundreds of millions of years.
          These woods and their pooling waters have seen Timucua and Calusa,
          Appalachee and Seminoles, Spanish Conquistadores and French Huguenots,
          bucanneers like JosÃ© Gaspar, Haitian rebels like Georges Biassou,
          Cuban exiles, Puerto Rican refugees, and immigrants from all over the

        The point is this: software is about timelessness and change. You have
        to think about the past and the future, and the diversity of your
        options. It's always in the back of your mind. Tech debt, project
        structure, dependency choices. You have to think about who will inherit
        your code, just as the Earth. It's all a careful game of timelessness
        and change.
      </p>
      <Quote>
        Computer Science is Applied Math, and Software Engineering is Applied
        Philosophy

      <p>
        I have never seen a more apt metaphor. I majored in Philosophy at
        Florida State University and started programming because I was obsessed
        with literature and wanted a better resource for picking it apart. I
        built <a href="https://anno.wiki">anno.wiki</a>. With that project I
        learned Python and JavaScript, Flask and SQLAlchemy, deployment and
        maintenance, database design and application structuring. I found myself
        fascinated by how much deep thinking I had to do about the long term
        maintainability and expansibility of the project itself.
      </p>

        In short, I fell in love with software. A few years later I started
        working in the industry. I've done contracts and W2s. All I know is
        this: I love the philosophy of it. The choices between static and
        dynamic languages, opinionated and unopinionated frameworks, fast code
        and readable code. Reading a book is a lot like talking to someone in
        the past. Writing code is a lot like talking to someone in the future.
