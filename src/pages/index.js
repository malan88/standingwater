        and <span className="change">change</span>. You have to think about the
        past and the future, and the diversity of your options. It's always in
        the back of your mind. Tech debt, project structure, dependency choices.
        You have to think about who will inherit your code, just as the Earth.
        It's all a careful game of eternity and change.

        I have never seen a more apt metaphor. I majored in Philosophy at
        Florida State University and started programming because I was obsessed
        with literature and wanted a better resource for picking it apart. I
        built <a href="https://anno.wiki">anno.wiki</a>. With that project I
        learned Python and JavaScript, Flask and SQLAlchemy, deployment and
        maintenance, database design and application structuring. I found myself
        fascinated by how much deep thinking I had to do about the long term
        maintainability and expansibility of the project itself.

        In short, I fell in love with software. A few years later I started
        working in the industry. I've done contracts and W2s, frontend, backend,
        and fullstack. I've done scrapers and hardware. But all I know is this:
        I love the philosophy of it. The choices between static and{" "}
        <span className="dynamic" style={{ display: "inline-block" }}>
          dynamic
        </span>{" "}
        languages, opinionated and unopinionated frameworks, fast code and
        readable code. Is this one-liner too complex? Should I{" "}
        <span style={{ color: "grey" }}>/* drop in a comment */</span> or just
        rewrite it?

        Reading a book is a lot like listening to someone in the past. Writing
        code is a lot like talking to someone in the future.
